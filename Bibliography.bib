  abstract = {External noise paradigms have been widely used to probe different
	levels of visual processing (Pelli & Farell, 1999). A basic assumption
	of this paradigm is that the processing strategy is noise-invariant,
	remaining the same in low and high external noise. We tested this
	assumption by examining crowding in a detection task where traditionally
	crowding has no effect. In the first experiment, we measured detection
	thresholds for a vertically oriented sine wave grating (target) surrounded
	by four sine wave gratings (flankers) that were either vertically
	or horizontally oriented. At low noise levels, the detection threshold
	for the target was unaffected by the orientation of the flankers--there
	was no crowding. Surprisingly, however, there was crowding for detection
	at high noise levels: the threshold increased for the similarly-oriented
	flankers. This suggests that high noise triggered a change in processing
	strategy, increasing the range of space or features over which the
	visual signal was sampled. In a second experiment, we evaluated the
	impact of the spatial and temporal window of the noise on this crowding
	effect. Although crowding was observed for detection when the spatial
	and/or temporal window of the noise was localized (i.e. identical
	to the signal window), no crowding was observed when the noise was
	spatially and temporally extended (i.e. continuously displayed, full
	screen dynamic noise). Our results show that certain spatiotemporal
	distributions of external noise can elicit a change in processing
	strategy, invalidating the noise-invariant assumption that underlies
	external noise paradigms. In contrast, spatiotemporally extended
	noise maintains the required noise-indifference, perhaps because
	it matches the characteristics of the internal noise that determines
	the contrast threshold in low noise.},
